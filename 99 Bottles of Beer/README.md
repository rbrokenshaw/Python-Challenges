<h1>[PROJECT] 99 Bottles of Beer On the Wall Lyrics</h1>

<h2>GOAL</h2>

<p>Create a program that prints out every line to the song "99 bottles of beer on the wall." This should be a pretty simple program, so to make it a bit harder, here are some rules to follow.</p>

<h2>RULES</h2>

<ol>
	<li>If you are going to use a list for all of the numbers, do not manually type them all in. Instead, use a built in function.</li>
	<li>Besides the phrase "take one down," you may not type in any numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics.</li>
	<li>Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word "bottles" becomes singular.</li>
	<li>Put a blank line between each verse of the song.</li>
</ol>
