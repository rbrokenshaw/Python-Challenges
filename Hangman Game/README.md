<h1>[Project] Hangman Game</h1>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>Create a program that selects a random word and then allows the user to guess it in a game of hangman. Like the real game, there should be blank spots for each letter in the word, and a part of the body should be added each time the user guesses a letter than is not in the answer (you may choose how many wrong turns the user can make until the game ends).</p>

<h2>Subgoals<h2>

<ol>
	<li>If the user loses, print out the word at the end of the game.</li>
	<li>Create a "give up" option.</li>
</ol>
