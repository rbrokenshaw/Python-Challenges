<h1>[PROJECT] Pythagorean Triples Checker</h1>

<h2>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</h2>

<p>If you do not know how basic right triangles work, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple">read this article on wikipedia.</a></p>

<h2>MAIN GOAL</h2>

<p>Create a program that allows the user to input the sides of any triangle, and then return whether the triangle is a Pythagorean Triple or not.</p>

<h3>SUBGOALS</h3>

<p>If your program requires users to input the sides in a specific order, change the coding so the user can type in the sides in any order. Remember, the hypotenuse (c) is always the longest side.</p>

<p>Loop the program so the user can use it more than once without having to restart the program.</p>
