<h1>[Project] Magic 8 Ball</h1>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>I'm sure you've used a magic 8 ball at one point in your life. You ask it a question, turn it right side up and it gives an answer by way of a floating die with responses written on it. You can create one in python. You must:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Allow the user to enter their question</li>
	<li>Display an in progress message( i.e. "thinking")</li>
	<li>Create 20 responses, and show a random response</li>
	<li>Allow the user to ask another question or quit</li>
</ol>

<h2>Bonus</h2> 

<p>Using whatever module you like, add a gui. Your gui must have:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A box for users to enter the question</li>
	<li>At least 4 buttons: Ask , clear(the text box), play again and quit(this must close the window)</li>
</ol>
