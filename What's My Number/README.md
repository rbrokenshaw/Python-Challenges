<h1>[Challenge] What's My Number</h1>

<p>Between 1 and 1000, there is only 1 number that meets the following criteria. While it could be manually figured out with pen and paper, it would be much more efficient to write a program that would do this for you. With that being said, your goal is to find out which number meets these criteria. To find out if you have the correct number, click the link at the bottom of this main post.</p>

	<li>The number has two or more digits.</li>

	<li>The number does NOT contain a 1 or 7 in it.</li>
	<li>The sum of all of the digits is less than or equal to 10.</li>
	<li>The first two digits add up to be odd.</li>
	<li>The second to last digit is even.</li>
