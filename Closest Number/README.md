<h1>Closest Number</h1>

<p>Given non-zero two integers N and M. The problem is to find the number closest to N and divisible by M. If there are more than one such number, then output the one having maximum absolute value.</p>

<h2>Input:</h2>

<p>The first line consists of an integer T i.e number of test cases. T testcases follow.  The first and only line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M.</p>

<h2>Output:</h2>
<p>For each testcase, in a new line, print the closest number to N which is also divisible by M.</p>

<h2>Constraints:</h2> 
<p>1 <= T <= 100<br>
-1000 <= N, M <= 1000</p>

<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>Input:<br>
2<br>
13 4<br>
-15 6<br>
Output:<br>
12<br>
-18</p>
